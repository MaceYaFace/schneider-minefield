# schneider-minefield
 Solution for Schneider recruitment technical test, implementing explicitly required features

## Candidates for future enhancement
1) Controllability of randomised elements for better testability
2) Expanded unit testing into edge case error scenarios given the above
3) Add explicit reward, failure and error outputs to the console
4) User customisable options at startup
